Something is slowing down our slider, is it the constant removeall/repaint functions?
Could we target the revalidate and repaints so they are doing less work?

Match Scheduler sometimes gets stuck on creating Match Week 12.
There will be 8 games left and we are unable to arrange 2 weeks where a team doesn't play twice..
FIXED WITH REMOVING MATCH WEEK 12 AND ADDING FIXTURES BACK TO ARRAY

Match Play button must replace advance button on scheduler
